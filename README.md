# Cosmic Vision: NASA Space App Challenge 2024  

## Overview  
The Cosmic Vision project is a web-based interactive space exploration app designed for the NASA Space App Challenge 2024. The app allows users to explore the solar system and beyond through an interactive 3D model. It features real-time tracking of celestial bodies and provides educational resources about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and space exploration.  

### Key Features  
Real-Time Celestial Body Tracking: Visualize the movement of planets and other space objects in real time.  
3D Solar System Model: An interactive model that allows users to explore the solar system.  
NEO Detection and Analysis: Displays near-Earth objects and their orbits.  
Educational Resources: Information on space exploration and celestial bodies.  
### Technologies Used  
HTML/CSS: Front-end structure and design with Bootstrap for responsive layout.  
JavaScript: Real-time interactivity and 3D rendering using the THREE.js library.  
Spline Viewer: Embeds a 3D scene for an enhanced user experience.  
GSAP Animation: Used for smooth transitions and animations throughout the app.  
API Integration: Fetches and displays data about NEOs.  
### Files  
index.html: Main landing page with the 3D viewer and introductory content.  
graph.html: Contains the enhanced solar system simulation where users can interact with celestial bodies and control various features like simulation speed, orbit visibility, and more.  
### How to Run  
Open index.html in a web browser to access the main landing page.  
Click on "Launch Cosmic View" to enter the interactive 3D solar system view found in graph.html.  
Use the provided controls to modify the view, toggle orbits, and search for specific celestial objects.
